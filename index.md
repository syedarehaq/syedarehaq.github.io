## About

Syed Arefinul Haque is an NLP Research Scientist working at Advanced Analytics team at [Independence Blue Cross (IBX)](https://www.ibx.com/), where he primarily focuses on extracting insights from unstructured text data, such as call center transcripts, electronic health records, and benefit documents using various NLP methods. His collaborative research projects include creating and evaluating large language models from insurance claims to predict future healthcare visit sequences of individuals. He has developed generative AI-based solutions for question-answer generation, entity disambiguation, keyword extraction, and knowledge graph visualization pipelines from unstructured texts.

Before this role, he worked as an Artificial Intelligence Fellow at [office of translation sciences](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/office-translational-sciences), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and created a pioneering AI-enabled software prototype to identify adverse drug event (ADE) safety signals from free-text discharge summaries in clinical notes to enhance opioid drug safety and aid related research activities at the FDA.

He received his Ph.D. in Network Science from [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/phd), [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) on 2022. This interdiscplinary program allowed him to interact and collaborate with mentors who come from diverse range of disciplines such as Physics, Sociology, Epidemiology, Computer Science, and Communication Studies. In his PhD projects, he used Network Science and NLP methods to identify gender and racial diversity in researchers and experts, and how ideas related to gender diversity move between one university to another. One of his other PhD research projects involved working on epidemiology. Specifically, he created contact matrices to model the transmission of influenza and other infectious diseases.

He is from Bangladesh where he completed BBA in finance from [IBA](https://www.iba-du.edu/), [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/), and MSc in Computer Science from [United International University](http://www.uiu.ac.bd/).
