## About

I am a fifth year PhD Student at Northeastern University's Network Science PhD program. This interdiscplinary program allowed me to interact and collaborate with my mentors who come from Physics, Sociology, Epidemiology, Computer Science, and Communication Studies. Currently I am using Network Science techniques to identify gender and racial diversity in researchers, and how ideas related to gender diversity move between one university to another. In the near past I have worked on epidemiology projects such as creating contact matrices for mobility modeling.

I am from Bangladesh where I completed my BBA in finance from IBA, University of Dhaka, and MSc in Computer Science from United International University.
