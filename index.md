# Hello!

I am a PhD Candidate in Network Science, and in May I will become one of the first to graduate from this innovative interdisciplinary program at Northeastern University. For my dissertation, I have delved into the most minute details of mobile money payment systems and built up a broadly applicable way to analyze large-scale transaction data. Along the way I have found that the movement of money can be a *fascinating* perspective to take on Economics.     
      
*I am on the Economics job market and will be attending the 2020 ASSA meeting in San Diego.*
